# TirePressureMonitoringSystem

Write the unit tests for the Alarm class, refactor the code as much as you need to make the class testable.

The Alarm class is designed to monitor tire pressure and set an alarm if the pressure falls outside of the expected range. The Sensor class provided for the exercise simulates the behaviour of a real tire sensor, providing random but realistic values.
